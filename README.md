# Binary-Search-Trees

A. I came at the lab rather straightforward, mainly using inspiration from our notes in class and then the textbook. 
B. In general the time complexities for insertion, Searching and Deletion is O(h) where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case in a scenario where one would have to travel from the root of the tree to the deepest node, there heiight of the tree might become n and the time 
complexity of insert and search might potentially become O(n).

D.  I believe by making a menu and leaving detailed comments throughout my program that it is pretty usable so I don't see any issue for change there. In terms of efficienty I know that I have several lines of code where I could have solved what I wanted to do much more shorter but rather 
I used longer lines because It was what I felt comfortable with. Lastly in terms of robustness I have no thoughts as to how  I could improve its quality as everything seems to be working well to me.
